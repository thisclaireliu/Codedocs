# PageTrail

PageTrail is a small personal CLI tool to track reading progress for books.

The idea is simple:
- keep a local JSON file with your books
- log how many pages you read at different times
- get a quick overview of how your reading habit evolves

This is a solo side project and is not meant to be a polished product. It is just a lightweight helper to keep notes about reading sessions from the terminal.
